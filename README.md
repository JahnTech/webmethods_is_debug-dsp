# Debugging Integration Server DSPs (Dynamic Server Pages)

When building complex DSPs (Dynamic Server Pages) on webMethods
Integration Server it is sometimes not clear what data are
actually available at run-time.

This package contains a set of demo pages, accessible from
its home page, to demonstrate the use of the built-in
service `pub.flow:tracePipeline`.

With that service you see exactly what data are currently
available on the server side. Just have a look into
the `server.log` file of Integration Server.

There is also a [YouTube video about this package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UynxYtqezh8) .

For more information on how to develop DSPs, please have
a look at the [Dynamic Server Pages and Output Templates Developer's Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/webmethods-integration/wm-integration-server/11.1.0?topic=guide-using-dynamic-server-pages-dsps).
